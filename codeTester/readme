This is a basic HTML testing application.  It is similar in nature to the application provided by 
W3schools though it is programmed using distinctly different code and has a unique design.  
The program also allows for exporting the code once the client is happy with the general layout.  
The exporting is done through a button.  Javascript can be tested in the application.

Limitations exist in the program.  Though the applicaiton will work in many browsers, it's intended to be used in Firefox.
No display plugins are included for Chrome or any other browser other than Firefox.

Future works should address naming and choice of the tags in the body of the program.  The current design is vulnerable to 
unintended display changes if the user names a tag with the same name as one of the parent tags in the applicaiton.  The best
approach to dealing with this current limitation is to only reference tags by id and to obviously not use any id's 
already used in the application.   

Although JavaScript can be tested in the applicaiton, it's primary purpose is for the quick production of layouts.  Users
of the application should not expect too much in terms of dynamic functionality though it is possible to do so.

It's a pretty cool program that allows clients to quickly generate nice layouts without having to open a text editor.
Also saves on the time needed to save and export files as HTML pages.
