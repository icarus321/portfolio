This is a script that acquires data from online FTP sites.
The function defined takes two parameters which are the url of the site and
the name of the files you wish to download.

The script uses a convention similar to wildcards.
When you list the files you wish you can use abbreviated names.

The script is useful when you have a lot of files to acquire that
have similar naming conventions or when you have a few very large datasets
you need.  If you only have a few files, it's probably not all that beneficial.

This script works in almost every FTP and usually requires no changes from site to site.

It's currently setup to acquire zip files but if adaptations are needed they can be
implemented in one or two lines of code.

Very reusable!
